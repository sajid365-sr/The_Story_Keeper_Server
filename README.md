# Welcome to my Project.

This project was created by `Sajid Sorker`.

## Project Category: Old book selling website.
## Website Name: (The Story Keeper).
## LiveWebsite Link: ``

## Some Features

`1` It's my first full stack website with the implementation of front end, backend, server and with live payment method.

`2` The main feature and most interesting is Stripe payment method. I've implemented stripe card payment on this website.

`3` Another important things is admin dashboard setup. This website has three types of dashboard one for the Admin, one for the seller and one for the buyer.

`4` The Admin can see all buyer and all seller. Also can delete any buyer and seller. The buyer can buy a product make a product as a wishList item. Can see them on the dashboard. The seller can add a new book for selling and monitor their status on seller dashboard.

`5` New type of error element is setup for this project which RouterError [https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/error-element] from React Router.

`6` You can upload image from your devise on this website using imagebb. Either your user photo update or add a new book to sell.

`7` Another important things was to hide sensitive code like firebase config and mongoDB user and 
password, stripe payment secret and JWT also. So I've implement environment variable both client and server side.

`8` This project was created by using React and also used react router. So, you can easily access one page to another within a moment.

`9` I've used Tailwind here as a CSS Library and use daisyUi and also a tiny amount of Flowbite as a CSS plugin.
